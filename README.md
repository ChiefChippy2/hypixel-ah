# What is this
This is a project to make a realtime dashboard of skyblock auctions
# Doesn't that exist already
Yes, but they are separate and not really good
# TODO
1. Set up backend
    - [x] Smart & Persistent database update
    - [x] WS connections to client to emit changes
    - [x] Rate limiter
2. Set up frontend ( site )
    - Device Responsive
    - Real-time feeling ( almost real-time updates, notifications, etc)
3. Set up discord bot
    - No notifications in dms with in ( maybe donators only )
    - Auction watch
    - Auction "dashboard" in a followable channel
4. Extensions
    - Make it possible to see if the item is overpriced/underpriced
    - Accounts?
    - Push notifs?
